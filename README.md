# weight-measurment-app
This project is a desktop application for Windows that reads weight measurements from a serial-connected weighing device (using the RS-232 protocol), displays live data, evaluates test results, and generates PDF reports. The app is built with Python and Tkinter, and is designed for easy use in industrial or laboratory environments.
